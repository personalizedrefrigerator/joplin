# Joplin for Students

Joplin is an excellent tool to keep your coursework and assignments organised and easily accessible. Here are some ideas on how Joplin can be beneficial for students:

## 1\. Keep Your Notes Organised in Notebooks

Store all your information, coursework, class notes, and other essential resources in Joplin throughout the school year. Create a dedicated notebook for each class and add sub-notebooks for specific topics, notes, or projects related to that class. You can categorise notes using tags to group similar topics or types of assignments.

Synchronise your notes across multiple devices so that you can take notes on your tablet during class and review them later on your laptop or phone.

## 2\. Take Handwritten Notes

For students who enjoy the traditional feel of handwriting, Joplin provides excellent support for handwritten notes. Using a stylus on a tablet or touchscreen device, you can easily integrate your handwritten notes into Joplin. This feature is perfect for capturing complex diagrams, equations, and sketches that may be difficult to type out.

## 3\. Manage Task Lists, To-Dos, and Reminders

Joplin is a fantastic tool for managing task lists, to-dos, and reminders, helping students stay organised and on top of their academic responsibilities. Create detailed to-do lists with checkboxes, set reminders for upcoming deadlines, and prioritise tasks to ensure nothing is overlooked. This functionality makes Joplin a powerful personal organiser, enabling you to manage coursework, assignments, and personal tasks all in one place.

## 4\. Collaborate on Group Projects

Collaboration on group projects becomes simple and efficient with Joplin. Share notebooks and notes with peers, allowing for real-time updates and collective brainstorming. This shared workspace facilitates seamless communication and coordination, ensuring all group members are on the same page. Whether dividing tasks, sharing research, or compiling final reports, Joplin’s collaborative features streamline the group project process.

## 5\. Multimedia Support

You can enrich your notes in Joplin by adding images, attachments, and photos to capture and store information from lectures or experiments. Take full advantage of each device you use, whether it’s your phone’s camera for attaching photos, a stylus on a tablet for handwritten notes, or a desktop computer for writing and editing assignments. Thanks to the synchronisation feature, you can access your notes on any device of your choice, even offline.
