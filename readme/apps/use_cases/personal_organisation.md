# Joplin for Personal Organisation

Joplin can revolutionise your personal organisation by centralising a variety of tasks, to-do lists, and ideas. This article delves into how Joplin can enhance your personal organisation.

## 1\. Prepare and Organise Your Trips and Holidays

When planning a trip or holiday, Joplin helps you keep track of all essential details, including hotel reservations, booking confirmations, attractions, and places to visit.

### Examples:

- Store all booking details and reservation confirmation numbers in Joplin, ensuring that critical information is consolidated in one easily accessible place.  
- Create a budget for your trip. List potential expenses such as flights, accommodation, meals, transport, and souvenirs. Joplin can help you manage and monitor your budget.  
- Make a list of potential destinations, attractions, and activities. Note the best times to visit, local customs, and must-try local cuisines. You can also create a detailed daily itinerary.  
- Prepare a packing list. For better organisation, categorise items such as clothing, toiletries, gadgets, and travel documents.

You can also attach PDFs for future reference. Since Joplin operates offline-first, you can access your notes anywhere on synchronised devices.  

*Bonus: Joplin notes are end-to-end encrypted, so your documents and information are stored securely.*
