# Scanning multi-page documents

The mobile app supports a "scan notebook" workflow that allows quickly creating a note from pictures of multiple pages. To use it,

2. Take a photo of each page to be scanned.
3. Click "next".
   - This opens a screen with a several options for creating the new note. The total number of photos should be listed near the last-taken photo preview.
4. Select a target notebook.
5. Click "create note".

The photos taken in step 2 are added to a new note.
