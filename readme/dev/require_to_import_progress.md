# `require()` → `import` Migration Progress

Tracks the effort to migrate `const X = require('...')` to typed `import` statements so values pulled in from other modules carry real types instead of implicit `any`.

## Goal

Replace `const X = require('...')` with a typed `import` whenever possible and the change is mechanical. `require()` is fine to keep when the imported module has no types — it already returns implicit `any`, so no `: any` or eslint-disable is needed. The aim is to narrow `require` to the cases where it's actually load-bearing, and let the type checker cover the rest.

## Rules

For each `const X = require('...')`:

1. **Convert to a typed `import`** when types exist:
   - The module ships its own `.d.ts` (check `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` for a `types` field).
   - A matching `@types/<pkg>` is already installed.
   - The module is an internal `@joplin/*` package or a relative path to a `.ts` file.
   - It's a Node built-in (`path`, `fs`, etc.) — but confirm the installed `@types/node` covers the specific submodule (e.g. `readline/promises` needs ≥ 17).
2. **Pick the import form that matches the module's shape:**
   - Named exports: `import { foo, bar } from 'pkg'` (use `{ foo as bar }` to rename rather than a separate `const`).
   - `module.exports = X` style: with `esModuleInterop: false` (this repo's setting), use `import * as X from 'pkg'`. `import X from 'pkg'` only works when the typings declare a real default export.
3. **Leave the `require()` in place** when:
   - The module has no types available — migrating would force a `// @ts-ignore`, a new `declare module` shim, or a fresh `@types/*` install.
   - There's an explicit comment explaining why `require()` is needed (RN bundler compatibility, conditional / lazy / side-effect load, dynamic path).
   - It's part of a `: typeof X = require(...)` pattern already typed via a paired `import type` — a deliberate runtime workaround.
   - Converting would require non-mechanical refactoring.
4. **Don't install new `@types/*` packages or upgrade dependencies** as part of this migration. The aim is to surface existing types, not expand the dependency graph.
5. **Don't make whitespace-only changes** to surrounding code (per `CLAUDE.md`).
6. **Don't add explanatory comments** unless the *why* is non-obvious (e.g. "needs `import *` because the package uses `module.exports = ...`").
7. After each package, run `yarn tsc --noEmit` from the package directory to verify nothing broke. The pre-commit hook handles linting and spellcheck.

## Files to never touch

- `packages/generator-joplin/generators/app/templates/**` — Yeoman template; package lacks a `typescript` dep.
- `packages/app-cli/tests/support/plugins/*/api/types.ts` and similar — regenerated plugin API copies.
- Anything under `**/node_modules/**` or `**/build/**`.

## Workflow

- One PR per package, smallest first.
- **Update this file as you go, not at the end.** Sessions can be auto-compacted or interrupted; the on-disk file is the source of truth.
  - After each file: add an entry to the package's **Per-package detail** subsection.
  - After each package: update the **Status** table row.
  - For large packages (`lib`, `app-desktop`, `app-mobile`), checkpoint the row every ~20 files.
- When resuming, re-read this file first and compare entries against the live state with:
  ```bash
  grep -rn --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" -E "^\s*const\s+[^=]+=\s*require\(" packages/<name>/
  ```
  Trust the file, not memory.

## Status

Counts captured 2026-05-25, before any work. `const X = require(...)` occurrences in `*.ts`/`*.tsx` source files, excluding `node_modules/` and `build/`. Some will legitimately stay as `require()` after evaluation (untyped libraries, RN bundler workarounds, etc.) — the "Converted" column tracks how many were actually migrated.

Total in-scope `require()` calls at start: **559** (counted across `*.ts`/`*.tsx`, excluding `**/node_modules/**` and `**/build/**`).

## Recommended order

Smallest first so the workflow stabilises before the large ones:

1. Warm-up: pdf-viewer, fork-uslug, default-plugins, editor, plugin-repo-cli, htmlpack (~10 requires total)
2. utils (9)
3. renderer (23)
4. server (27)
5. tools (49)
6. app-cli (54)
7. app-mobile (61)
8. app-desktop (131)
9. lib (195) — biggest; do last so prior packages inform the work

## Per-package detail

Each package gets a subsection added below when work begins. Format:

```markdown
## packages/<name>
Session date: YYYY-MM-DD

Files processed:
- path/to/file.ts — N converted, M left (reasons for skips)

Files skipped entirely:
- path/to/file.ts — reason
```

## packages/pdf-viewer
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files skipped entirely:
- main.tsx — `react-dom/client` has types and tsc passes the conversion, but the package's build scripts are all disabled (`tsc: ""`, `build: ""`) and the bundling pipeline that produces the `vendor/lib/@joplin/pdf-viewer/` artifact isn't traceable from this repo. The author explicitly chose `require()` to fix a React 18 warning (commit 58da15432). Leave alone until the bundling path is understood.

## packages/fork-uslug
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files skipped entirely:
- lib/uslug.ts — `node-emoji` has no types installed.

## packages/default-plugins
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files processed:
- build.ts — 1 converted (`yargs` → `import * as yargs from 'yargs'`).

## packages/editor
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files skipped entirely:
- CodeMirror/utils/formatting/RegionSpec.ts — imports from `@joplin/lib/string-utils-common`, which is a deliberate `.js` file (no `.d.ts`) per the comment at the top of that file.
- CodeMirror/CodeMirror5Emulation/CodeMirror5Emulation.ts — same as above.

## packages/plugin-repo-cli
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files skipped entirely:
- commands/updateRelease.ts — `node-fetch` is `require(...).default` with an explicit comment linking the known node-fetch issue; `gh-release-assets` has no types installed.

## packages/htmlpack
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files processed:
- packToWriter.ts — 1 converted (`html-entities`).
- index.ts — 1 converted (`datauri/sync` — uses `import X = require(...)` because the package uses `export = X`).
- utils/parseHtmlAsync.ts — 1 converted (`@joplin/fork-htmlparser2`).

## packages/utils
Session date: 2026-05-25

Files processed:
- Logger.ts — 2 converted (`moment`, `async-mutex`), 1 left (`sprintf-js` — no @types installed).
- html.ts — 2 converted (`html-entities`, `@joplin/fork-htmlparser2`).

Files skipped entirely:
- time.ts — 2 deliberate `const X: typeof X = require(...)` workarounds for React Native bundler compatibility (already typed via paired `import type`).
- ipc.ts — `tcp-port-used` has no types.
- cli.ts — `readline/promises` is not in the installed `@types/node` (16.x); migrating would require a node-types upgrade.
