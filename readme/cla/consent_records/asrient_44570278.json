For all the cases that the library fails, we show a message to the user indicating the action has failed. The library does not provide any way to determine from beforehand if a pdf is compatible or not.\r\n\r\npdfAnnotate and pdf.js being different projects does not provide any easy way to work well together. After adding an annotation we need to extract the updated pdf blob and feed it back to pdf.js and re-render the page. All this cause a performance penalty. Discussion: https://github.com/highkite/pdfAnnotate/issues/12.\r\n\r\nDuring first annotation addition, there is a known lag that happens when the file has more than 100 pages, but for subsequent addition the lag does not occur.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend using this feature with big pdfs over 300 pages since for each annotation change we are extracting the new pdf blob from pdfAnnotate library each time this might even cause the app to crash in certain cases. \r\n\r\n### Related pdfAnnotate issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/highkite/pdfAnnotate/issues/63\r\nhttps://github.com/highkite/pdfAnnotate/issues/52\r\nhttps://github.com/highkite/pdfAnnotate/issues/12",

			"body": "I just gave it a try but it doesn't work so well - many pdf files don't have the text in a nice layout, so underlining or highlighting doesn't work well (and in some cases, as you mentioned, it doesn't work at all).\r\n\r\nIt would be more useful to have annotation tools like what macOS Preview provide - a way to draw on top of the PDF, add text, etc. That way all can be done regardless of the PDF. In fact, for now it's much better to open the PDF as an external resource, make the annotations in Preview and close it.\r\n\r\nSo with this in mind I don't think we'll merge this for now. It could be used as a starting point if someone else wants to add proper annotation tools later on.",
