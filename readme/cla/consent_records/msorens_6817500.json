Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWill Rogers once wrote _\"You never get a second chance to make a first impression.\"_ That is particularly true when it comes to a new user of a software application.  After having high expectations from the reviews I had read, my own first impression of Joplin was rather disappointing.  It was disappointing because it looked like Joplin was broken.  I imported a good number of notes from Evernote (2000 objects or so), then set up synchronization to make that data accessible to my other devices. I then went to my other computer and set up synchronization there, where I expected, after a time, the second machine would then be a mirror of the first.\r\n\r\nBut not so. It only had a portion of my notes and, oddly, none of the folder structure. If I was a non-technical user--which is a very appropriate audience for Joplin--I would likely say, \"Oh, well, time to try some other application instead of Joplin.\" 😞 But I quickly realized what was going on: I needed to pay attention to the synchronization status on the initial machine! It turns out that had simply aborted after only a portion of the notes were uploaded. And since, it turns out, notes are all uploaded before any folders, that fully explained what I was seeing. Once I figured that out, I hit the \"Synchronize\" button a few more times, waited for the upload sync to finish on my source machine, then sync'ed on my target machine... and all my notes and folders were there. 🎉 \r\n\r\nThis was all user error, of course, but I had nothing to warn me that I was using the application incorrectly. 😱 \r\n\r\nI see a multi-prong solution:\r\n\r\n1. Document it (this PR). Granted, not everyone reads docs, but some do. That would have saved me from frustration.\r\n\r\n2. Upon starting the very first synchronization, pop up a big banner immediately saying, to the effect, \"Give the upload sync a chance to finish before you attempt to sync on other devices.\"\r\n\r\n3. Warn during **upload** sync if user attempts to quit the app. That is, if the user tries to quit the application and the upload sync is not complete, pop up a warning asking them if they really want to quit or continue the sync.  \r\n\r\n4. Warn when starting **download** sync on a second device if the initial upload sync on the first device has not completed. Pop up a warning that they will need to wait for the upload sync to finish before seeing complete and correct results on the new device.\r\n\r\n(If the above items (2) through (4) are acceptable enhancements, I will be happy to add an issue for each of them.)\r\n",
