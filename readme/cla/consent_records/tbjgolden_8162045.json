Maybe they haven't localised it consistently? I wonder if, as technical people, we use trash more than typical users because we need to refer to it within our code, e.g. `~/.Trash`? Thanks for explaining the technical and logistical issues.\r\n\r\nOn one hand it's a pure Americanism - I'd wager that if I asked the average non-coder Briton where their deleted files go to, they'd say the Recycle Bin/Bin. But can also see why it might be awkward to change it from Trash to Bin after it has already been released.\r\n\r\n> And so another issue is we don't modify en_GB.po because it's automatically generated from the code. If there are other strings that need to be changed, you would need to modify them in the .ts/.js files instead.\r\n\r\nAh was wondering about this and why they were empty but also marked as translated, apologies\r\n\r\nGiven all that will close the PR but happy to reopen if you want to revisit.\r\n",

			"body": "Ok, makes sense. Although the documentation should not be such an issue. Most people still understand `trash`, even though `bin` is used in their every day speech. In fact I suspect that more people who learn English as their second language will learn trash and not bin.\r\nDon't get me started on what Irish, Scots, Welsh, Canadians, Aussis, and Kiwis use in their respective dialects... ;-)\r\n\r\nAs long as it doesn't mean the exact opposite (which is unfortunately possible between US and British English) it should be fine. I think the docs should use the term `trash` anyway, since more people are familiar with it.\r\n\r\nChanging all the .po files is a hassle, but doable. I have done it a few times before. I would have to look into how many source files use `trash` though. I can have a look at it when I have a bit more time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
