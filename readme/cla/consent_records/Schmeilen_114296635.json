		"body": "# Summary\r\nThis pull request should fix issue #9291 by changing the index.html file in note-viewer. In the code, there was another issue referenced, issue #7617, however, I've ran the test case indicated in the bug report and wasn't able to reproduce it, the behaviour of the application was the same before and after the changes. I've uploaded a video showing the fix so it's easier to detect any unwanted modifications to the application: https://youtu.be/ndEz3OySuTs.\r\n# Testing plan\r\n1. Open the markdown editor with text view next to it\r\n2. Create two notes\r\n3. Write some text to fill more than the length of the monitor\r\n4. Below that text, write a header (or sub-header)\r\n5. Include a reference to the target header in the other note\r\n6. On the note that doesn't include the header, click on the link to it\r\n7. Verify that the markdown editor now scrolls to the correct section and is synchronized with the text view instead of staying at the top of the note, disconnected from it",
