			"body": "> What are the \"wide-ranging consequences\"? Maybe it's a bug we need to fix rather than something we need to document\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a lot of links in a document, it is usually easier to collect them all at the bottom of the document and reference them in the content. This pairs really well with footnotes `[^1]`, for instance, as all references would be contained in the bottom of the document.\r\n\r\n**An example of how this could impact a user:**\r\n\r\nThe user copies and pastes a document from a GitHub repository into Joplin. Normally this works fine as long as you are in Markdown mode. However, if that document uses reference links, then all links will be inlined across the entire document. I would consider that rather destructive as it would reformat text/paragraphs where links exist.\r\n\r\nOptimally it would be awesome if Joplin could support editing reference links in Rich Text mode. However, that would be somewhat involved to implement. The extended benefit of this could be support for footnotes as well.",
