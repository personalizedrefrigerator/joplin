		"body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces ARM64 container pipeline for Joplin Server and adds the necessary dependencies for ARM64. I have successfully tested and used the image created in my repository on my Raspberry Pi 5.\r\n\r\nI have changed `ServerDockerImage` to build the container using Docker buildx (based on the `buildServerDocker.js` script) and I have changed `Main` to not been called for Joplin Server tags. I did all changes trying to maximize mimicking of the existing workflow.\r\n\r\n# Execution scenarios\r\n\r\n- `ServerDockerImage` is invoked from pull request or branch push \r\n   - The action builds the AMD64 container, pushes it to the local container store, and runs existing tests in `ServerDockerImage`.\r\n   - Tested successfully in my repository https://github.com/maresmar/joplin/actions/runs/10404305701\r\n- `ServerDockerImage` is invoked from `server-v1.2.3` tag\r\n   - The action builds both AMD64 and ARM64 containers, pushes these containers to Docker Hub, and uses the AMD64 container for existing tests in `ServerDockerImage`\r\n   - Tested successfully in my repository https://github.com/maresmar/joplin/actions/runs/10400289242\r\n   - Target containers from my reposiotry https://github.com/maresmar/joplin/pkgs/container/joplin/258405651?tag=3.0.2\r\n\r\n# Possible limitations\r\n\r\n- I didn't test the AMD64 container locally, but the existing tests are passing. \r\n- I was unable to test Docker Hub push and impact of `skip-duplicate-actions`\r\n- The `buildServerDocker.js` could be probably removed and `run_ci.sh` could be simplified, but I wasn't sure if you want to keep an local push script.\r\n- Docker tag is created from git tag, so to create `1.2.3-beta` the git tag has to be `server-v1.2.3-beta`.\r\n- Building both ARM64 and AMD64 containers took 1 hour and 40 minutes in my repository.\r\n",

			"body": "I was afraid you would ask me for something like this 😢. To be honest, I only know that these GitHub actions are large pieces of JavaScript that set up QEMU and Docker BuildX to work together in the default GitHub runner. I'm not very confident that I could do it better without missing many edge cases.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to change only the Docker-related parts, and most of the changes I've made are related to container image tag generation. What if I revert all the changes and just introduce a new job called `ServerDockerImageArm64` that would only upload the Docker arm64 image to the GitHub package registry?\r\n\r\nI could also try modifying `buildServerDocker.js` to use `docker buildx`, but setting up a local environment for multi-platform builds seems much more complex (see https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/), and I have never tried it. I usually use a branch to experiment with CI/CD, so I've never tried it on localhost. I could probably experiment with some mixed solution, like using `docker buildx build Dockerfile.server --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` in `buildServerDocker.js` and connecting it with these `docker/setup-qemu-action@v3` actions, but I'm not currently sure what changes I need to make to get it running on localhost or GitHub.",

			"body": "Thanks for clarifying. I have a preference for using TypeScript scripts for all this because it's generally easier and safer to write in that language, but if your GitHub Actions implementation works well, then why not.\r\n\r\nCould you please confirm what we will get once that action is executed? Currently the script pushes four tags:\r\n\r\n- beta\r\n- 3-beta\r\n- 3.0-beta\r\n- 3.0.1-beta\r\n\r\n(see here: https://hub.docker.com/r/joplin/server/tags )\r\n\r\nWill we get the same once we run your script?\r\n\r\nAlso looking at the existing buildServerDocker.ts file, can you think of anything that may be missing in your new implementation?",
