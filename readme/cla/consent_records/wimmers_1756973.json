			"body": "You must have spent quite a bit of time on this and unfortunately I'd rather not merge this. As a maintainer, before a big feature is developed, I'd like to see a discussion about it, a spec and a mockup of the UI. It doesn't necessarily mean it will be accepted but at least you won't waste time developing it if it's not.\r\n\r\nThe PR as it is would need to be reviewed and we'll need to spend time on working out the UX and how we really want this to work. That will take many hours of my time and unfortunately I don't have that kind of spare time at the moment, so I'd rather close so as not give false hopes to anybody.",
