		"body": "Resolves #3535\r\n\r\nConsider the first table row as header in the richtext editor automatically. Switching isn't needed anymore. This is based on https://tinymce.github.io/tinymce-demos/tables/customizing-the-table-toolbar.html.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n1. The new menu only contains the table size selection. As far as I see, most of the options are either covered by the table tooltip (insert, delete, properties) or incompatible with markdown (merge and split cells). Only the cut/paste options are missing. I could either try to add the cut/paste options to the tooltip or build the menu manually, as it was before. What would be the preferred way?\r\n2. There are some `any` types. I left them for now, since the surrounding code has them, too. Let me know if I should try to fix them.\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20230511_155150](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/assets/33229141/3b2fe2a4-70a8-4570-b229-22609d2c3e9e)",
