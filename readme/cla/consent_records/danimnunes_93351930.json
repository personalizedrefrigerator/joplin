		"body": "When a hyperlink is entered and confirmed with Enter or by clicking OK, everything works as expected. However, when canceling with Esc or the Cancel button, the focus shifts away from the pane. While Joplin seems to remain in focus, as evidenced by the ability to access the File menu by pressing Alt, it requires clicking back into the pane to resume typing. \r\n\r\nI identified the issue in the prompt function of the Smalltalk library. \r\n\r\nTo address this, I created a wrapper called SmalltalkFocusWrapper to resolve the focus loss problem upon canceling the modal. Now, when canceling the modal, the focus remains in the appropriate location.\r\n",
