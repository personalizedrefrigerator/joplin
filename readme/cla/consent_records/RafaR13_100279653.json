		"body": "Fixes: #10218 \r\nThe application's current behaviour is such that when one presses the hotkey to create a bulleted list (Ctrl+Alt+- by default), it doesn't work. I later realized that, if one changes the hotkey to a given command, instead of replacing it, the new hotkey is added and the default hotkey still works, although these hotkeys are handled differently while achieving the same result. Considering this and the fact that the bulleted list command isn't being handled at all, I added a verification in TinyMCE.tsx's onKeyDown function to verify if the default hotkey was being pressed, and if so, execute the command associated with the bulleted list directly. This provides a solution while the logic behind the treatment of hotkeys isn't fixed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease prefix the title with the platform you are targetting:\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of good titles:\r\n\r\n- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font\r\n- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error\r\n- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster\r\n\r\nAnd here's an explanation of the title format:\r\n\r\n- \"Desktop\" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)\r\n- \"Mobile\" for the mobile app (or \"Android\" / \"iOS\" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)\r\n- \"CLI\" for the CLI app\r\n\r\nIf it's two platforms, separate them with commas - \"Desktop, Mobile\" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with \"All\".\r\n\r\nIf it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.\r\n\r\nThen please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed. Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/dev/index.md\r\n\r\n-->",
