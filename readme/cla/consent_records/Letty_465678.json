Furthermore add a new custom element `Modal.tsx` for unified top and bottom margins in Modals. Other components can use this Modal instead of react native Modal.\r\nNotch margins for top are increased to `65px` and bottom to `35px`.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nTested on iPhone with and without notch\r\n\r\n\r\n**Add Link:**\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-07 at 11 24 53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465678/230588727-6694ba53-9203-4db8-a696-2cd06349a890.png)\r\n\r\n**Insert Tags:**\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-16 at 13 54 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465678/232308432-81ce2b73-fe42-4b19-a624-30fdc3ade6eb.png)\r\n",

By that point i have know idea which problems lead me to the decision, maybe the keyboard problems.\r\n\r\nSo the main issues here are all modals at the top: edit link and tags for sure and most likely the `Dropdown` component as well. You can see it in the language settings at `ConfigScreen`.\r\n\r\nWhat about a custom modal component? Just as a wrapper for the modal in general.\r\nPassing all props for the regular react-native modal and maybe some other if needed, child nodes and style it with the notch in mind.\r\nThis could be used for edit link, tags and everything what will may come later.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what your styleguide for dropdowns is. If the only difference is the position, the modal component could have a prop like `isDropdown`. But maybe this issue should be tackled separately. ",

So with this PR just the two modals in the screenshot will be fixed. \r\n\r\nI was checking, if this modal can be easily applied towards the dropdown, which is not the case. It was more a question if the PR should address the dropdown issue as well or make a separate issue and PR for that. I could look into that as well, if you like.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately i can't build Joplin for iOS at the minute, i have to check what is wrong with Xcode.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
