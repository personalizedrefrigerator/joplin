		"body": "I have not checked the entire document from beginning to end. But almost all missing and fuzzy phrases have been translated. I also corrected all the obvious typos and corrected some unfortunate wording that caught my eye.\r\n\r\nIn several places I did not understand at all the meaning of the original phrases in English. I did the translation, but left `fuzzy` markers in these places.\r\n\r\nThis is my first serious experience of participating in an open source project. And this is my first pull request. I apologize if I didn't do something quite right. I'm not sure how much I contribute to the translation and whether the `Last-Translator:` field in the file header needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nBest wishes, Vladimir Fedorchuk.",
