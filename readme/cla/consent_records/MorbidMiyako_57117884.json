		"body": "The new approach simply checks if there exists a folder with a deleted_time.\r\nIt seems that the only aspect influencing whether Trash is collapsible is the presence of a folder.\r\nIf this is to change, then its likely this information can be found in the store.\r\nThere are also a few safeguards implemented.\r\nFIrstly, if the issue of the Trash folder.childern.size reporting 0 regardless is resolved, it will simply skip over this addition.\r\nSecondly, by breaking as soon as proof is found Trash contains a folder any unnecessary iterations are prevented.\r\n\r\nUsing the store might allow for determining the number of items in the Trash, something that was commented to be considered tricky. Although I assume communication regarding this subject should be moved to the forum.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a visual explanation of the new behaviour: \r\n\r\nBy clicking the collapse all button its now possible to go between the following two states:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/176e2f6a-cc20-4091-b50c-d6e4b72fcf2d)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/757f70b6-9d32-4674-a42a-abfcc275cbfa)\r\n\r\nSee issue #12039 for more information regarding the bug that's resolved.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease prefix the title with the platform you are targetting:\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of good titles:\r\n\r\n- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font\r\n- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error\r\n- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster\r\n\r\nAnd here's an explanation of the title format:\r\n\r\n- \"Desktop\" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)\r\n- \"Mobile\" for the mobile app (or \"Android\" / \"iOS\" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)\r\n- \"CLI\" for the CLI app\r\n\r\nIf it's two platforms, separate them with commas - \"Desktop, Mobile\" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with \"All\".\r\n\r\nIf it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.\r\n\r\nThen please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed. Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/dev/index.md\r\n\r\n-->",
