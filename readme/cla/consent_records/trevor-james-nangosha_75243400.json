Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs described in issue #7587, (r) and (c) get rendered as ® and © when a note gets published and displayed in the browser. I used Joplin server(as a synchronisation target) to reproduce the problem and after some work, realised it could be solved by setting the **typographer** option in the class **MdToHtml** to false.\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots for the same content in the markdown editor, and also when published and viewed in a browser.\r\n**In the markdown editor**\r\n![issue7587md](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75243400/214295910-5143d186-87e4-46e7-be56-6bc08cc3be0a.PNG)\r\n\r\n**In the browser**\r\n![issue7587html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75243400/214296056-857e3b4c-96ff-44f1-ac1a-3b204aafff15.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
