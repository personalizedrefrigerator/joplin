			"body": "I wish this had been discussed on the forum first so as not to spend too much time on the implementation. I'm not very keen to add this to be honest because I don't think it's the right solution to whatever problem there is.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the linked threads, it seems people usually want to sort by date, but Naveen added this at some point - more recent notes have a higher weight. So maybe it's a matter of tweaking the algorithm further and give more importance to the note date.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of improving the search engine itself is that it will benefit the mobile app, CLI, API and plugins too.",

And I appreciate you spending time creating the PR but I feel what's missing, but that might be for another day, is a review of search in existing apps, weighting the pros and cons, and finding a solution that fits Joplin well. In the meantime I will close the PR then.",
