		"body": "The package installed using `npm i -s joplin-renderer` is relatively outdated, and using `const { MarkupToHtml } = require('joplin-renderer');` often leads to the error `e.apply is not a function`. To fix the outdated `README.md`, use the updated package by running `npm i @joplin/renderer` and initialize it with `const { MarkupToHtml } = require('@joplin/renderer');`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease prefix the title with the platform you are targetting:\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of good titles:\r\n\r\n- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font\r\n- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error\r\n- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster\r\n\r\nAnd here's an explanation of the title format:\r\n\r\n- \"Desktop\" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)\r\n- \"Mobile\" for the mobile app (or \"Android\" / \"iOS\" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)\r\n- \"CLI\" for the CLI app\r\n\r\nIf it's two platforms, separate them with commas - \"Desktop, Mobile\" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with \"All\".\r\n\r\nIf it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.\r\n\r\nThen please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed.
