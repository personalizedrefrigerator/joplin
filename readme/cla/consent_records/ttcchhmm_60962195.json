		"body": "This PR adds SAML support to Joplin.\r\n\r\n# Server\r\nBased on the [`samlify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/samlify) library that provides the SAML logic flow for Joplin Server.\r\n\r\nThis adds the following environment variables used as configuration parameters to Joplin Server :\r\n- `SAML_ENABLED`: If set to `true`, enables SAML support.\r\n- `DISABLE_BUILTIN_LOGIN_FLOW`: If set to `true`, all auth requests MUST go though SAML. Users can't log-in using Joplin-specific credentials and/or LDAP.\r\n- `SAML_IDP_CONFIG_FILE`: Should be a path to an XML file containing the metadata for the Identity Provider (IDP).\r\n- `SAML_SP_CONFIG_FILE`: Should be a path to an XML file containing the metadata for the Service Provider (SP, in this case Joplin).\r\n- `SAML_ORGANIZATION_DISPLAY_NAME`: Name of the organization, as shown on the log-in screen. Optional.\r\n\r\nThe XML files are standard SAML IDP/SP metadata that should be created by the identity solution.\r\n\r\n# Clients\r\nAs for the clients themselves, no additional libraries are needed, since the actual log-in process is happening in a web browser, outside of Joplin itself.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a new sync target, based on the one for Joplin Server: \"Joplin Server (Beta, SAML)\". We kept \"Beta\" in the name for this since the main Joplin Server target itself is currently considered as such.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> The log-in flow uses a callback to a `joplin://` URL, and thus requires that only one instance of Joplin is running at any given time. This is important for the desktop client, since the single instance lock is not enforced in the `dev` environment.\r\n\r\n## Log-in flow\r\nThe log-in process differs slightly if started from within a client or within the server web interface.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\n    graph TB;\r\n        12([From the server web interface]) --> 13[The user clicks 'Sign-in using your organization account']\r\n\r\n        13 --> 5\r\n\r\n        0([From a client]) --> 1\r\n\r\n        1[The user chooses the SAML sync target] --> 2[They enter the server's address]\r\n        2 --> 3[They click 'Sign-in using your organization account']\r\n        3 --> 4[The Joplin client opens the default web browser to an URL pointing to Joplin Server]\r\n        4 --> 5[Joplin Server reads its configuration and redirects the browser to the Identity Provider sign-in page]\r\n        5 --> 6[The user signs-in]\r\n        6 --> 7[The Identity Provider generates and signs a SAML payload, and redirects the browser to Joplin Server]\r\n        7 --> 8[Joplin Server validates the payload signature]\r\n\r\n        8 -- Client --- 9[If the signature is valid, Joplin Server creates a new token for this user]\r\n        9 --> 10[Using a joplin:// URL, the browser calls back into the client, with the new token]\r\n\r\n        8 -- Server web interface --- 11[If the signature is valid, a new session is created]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Testing and development\r\nFor development purposes, we used [`saml-idp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/saml-idp) as the Identity Provider, as it allows to quickly create new users on the fly and is simple to set up. After generating the keypair (look at the `saml-idp` documentation to see how), just running `npx saml-idp --acsUrl 'http://localhost:22300/api/saml' --audience http://localhost:22300 --issuer 'saml-idp'` is enough to get a test Identity Provider running, assuming that Joplin Server is running on `localhost:22300`.\r\n\r\nSince `saml-idp` does not support generating SP metadata, here is a sample configuration for the Service Provider part :\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"\r\n                     validUntil=\"2024-12-15T08:05:25Z\"\r\n                     cacheDuration=\"PT604800S\"\r\n                     entityID=\"Joplin\">\r\n    <md:SPSSODescriptor AuthnRequestsSigned=\"false\" WantAssertionsSigned=\"false\" protocolSupportEnumeration=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\">\r\n        <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat>\r\n        <md:AssertionConsumerService Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\"\r\n                                     Location=\"http://localhost:22300/api/saml\"\r\n                                     index=\"1\" />\r\n    </md:SPSSODescriptor>\r\n</md:EntityDescriptor>\r\n```",

			"body": "I don't think I can make the code more modular than it currently is. I refactored it a bit to help with your review (mostly by adding comments, but also by doing a bit of cleanup), and merged the current `dev` branch into mine. The only conflict I got was on a dictionary file, and after testing everything was still working as intended (on the SAML side, at least), so even if it's only one limited example it seems rather positive.\r\n\r\nThe new SAML sync target extends the base Joplin Server one, so on this topic I think I made things more modular than they were before by allowing the sync target to provide a session to `JoplinServerApi`, in addition to the regular login/password combo.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately since the SAML login process relies on a web browser, I didn't have a choice but to rely on a callback from a web page which means that I needed to use the `x-callback-url` scheme, and thus I had to add a new command that can be called externally (which means modifying part of the existing code). I don't think I can do this in a different way other than using a webview within the apps, and doing this would defeat part of the security benefit that comes with SAML. Furthermore, doing it that way would need even more code in the clients to handle this, so I think the current approach is the best one.\r\n\r\nAnd on the server, I had to modify `UserModel` since the only way to authenticate before was with a username and a password. This was required since the response from the Identity Provider is trusted (and we don't have the password anyways), and we need to create new users dynamically if they are not already known by the server. I also had to modify the `/login` route to add redirects as needed. Otherwise, the other modifications should be rather minor, and most of the actual SAML-related logic is within `routes/api/login.ts` and `utils/saml.ts`, which are new files.\r\n\r\nIf you have any tips about making this better, feel free to tell me so I can implement them.",
