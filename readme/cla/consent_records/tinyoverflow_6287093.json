		"body": "This PR adds an option to automatically hide the menu bar on desktop. It can still be shown with the alt key. There were two other related posts to this:\r\n- https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/hide-menubar/8731\r\n- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/1752\r\n\r\nI noticed on caveat: When toggling the menu bar, the webview or it's content doesn't resize automatically. This can be fixed by resizing the window, though. I have absolutely no experience with Electron and therefore couldn't solve this. Any help regarding this issue is appreciated.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/assets/6287093/d718c263-f87f-4d4e-8c37-85e9d7880323)\r\n",

As such, I suggest changing `Desktop: Implement PR #1752: Option to automatically hide the menu bar` to  `Desktop: Resolves #1752: New: Option to automatically hide the menu bar`. It may also make sense to check whether there's an issue (rather than a pull request) for this already (maybe https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/3894?).\r\n",

Though it is related to this PR, I'd prefer to create a seperate pull request for the feature requested in that issue.\r\n\r\nI've also changed a few more bits in this PR:\r\nThe `updateMenuBar` method is now only called when the current device is not a Mac. The method itself also received a guard clause to return early in case it's called anyway somewhere else in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, I've changed the window instantiation to hide the menu bar by default on startup. This is to prevent the menu bar from being visible for a short amount of time when the window loads before it get's hidden again. If hiding is disabled, it will be shown together with when the app gets rendered.",
