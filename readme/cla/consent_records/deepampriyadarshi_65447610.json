		"body": "Fixes #7612 \r\nThe issue was caused due to the function `addPluginAssets(assets)` in `./packages/app-desktop/gui/note-viewer/index.html` file. One of task of this function was to check loading multiple duplicate css/javascript files while switching between two notes. It works well when two notes share the same css styling (file) but it doesn't removes those css/javascript file links from the DOM tree which was loaded by some other notes and which shouldn't be applied to the current note being viewed. End result => the last appended link node for a css file overwrites the any previously loaded css file belonging to the current note being viewed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65447610/216077490-0cbac470-9097-4010-b8ec-0420674a85e3.png)\r\n",

I think the process of removing script/css will be equally, if not more, costly since then there would be 2 for loops. One which is already present which goes through assets list and second would be for parsing link nodes. So the former one seems to be a good solution. Also there's one more issue which I found now with the asset list which is passed as the parameter. It has duplicate entries for same CSS files. This only happens when switching between .md files and I think that is why the previous code was checking for any duplicate entries in the asset list. Although it served the purpose of not creating duplicate css/script link node but size of parameter passed keeps increasing on each note switch.",

It's adding and removing nodes that's more of a problem.",

			"body": "> Well, in most cases nothing needs to be added or removed, and looping a JS array costs pretty much nothing in terms of performance. It's adding and removing nodes that's more of a problem.\r\n\r\nThe performance does gets affected if the loop is called on every setHtml (even on single key press) call and on each call the JS array size increases.. Below is the code snippet of the `for loop` that runs through `pluginAssets` array, from current dev branch :- \r\nhttps://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/884260189cabef550a55dbe790678e5bdb0e83ed/packages/app-desktop/gui/note-viewer/index.html#L160-L172\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere a screen recording of what 's happening to the `pluginAssests` array with each setHtml call. Look at the zoomed in section at bottom centre. With just two lines in note, size of array became 90, out of which 73 are duplicate entries of the same file. You can verify from your end too. No doubt that this will stall the rendering as the above loop runs no matter what.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65447610/216852709-41ab3121-403e-4b7e-9974-dc426b6e3d35.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
