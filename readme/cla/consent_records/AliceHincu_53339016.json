		"body": "The problem here arises from the fact that \"All notes\" has as `selectedFolderId` the value _Folder_, even though it should have the value _SmartFilter_. By switching those two lines, the type is correctly set. Before, \"All notes\" section was treated as a Folder, and for each note it wouldn't show from what notebook it came. After this modification, the UI is correct.\r\n\r\nWhen the selected folder id is null, I set the default option to be the \"All notes\" folder.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I am unable to screen record to showcase this fix, because of some issues with my laptop, I am sorry.",
