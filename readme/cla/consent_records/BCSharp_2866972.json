Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/dev/index.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`Joplin_install_and_update.sh` automatically downloads (or upgrades to) the latest AppImage released on the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases). The binary is stored in a hard-coded location `$HOME/.joplin` which, while convenient (HOME dir always exists), leads to pollution of the user home directory.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an extra option to the installer script allowing for specifying an alternative installation/upgrade location, at the discretion of the user.\r\n\r\nExample use for a FreeDesktop-compliant system:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ ./Joplin_install_and_update.sh --install-dir=$XDG_DATA_HOME/joplin\r\n```\r\n",
