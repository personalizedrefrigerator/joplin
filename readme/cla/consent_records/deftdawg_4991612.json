		"body": "[Devbox](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox) is a tool that codifies and satisfies OS-specific dependencies using [Nix](https://nixos.org/); [DirEnv](https://direnv.net/) auto-loads `devbox` when entering a directory (must run `direnv allow` once to prevent hacks).\r\n\r\nWhen devbox+direnv are enabled together, the user need only checkout the repo and change into the directory and a full build environment will be automatically downloaded & configured.\r\n\r\nThis devbox.json has successfully built and run Joplin Desktop & CLI on MacOS (Apple Silicon) and Linux (NixOS); it should also work on any Linux distro including WSL.\r\n\r\n## MacOS / Apple Silicon\r\n<img alt=\"Joplin-Devbox-OSX\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/996c5247-db7c-4d7c-ad80-55b8528ceea3\">\r\n\r\n## Linux / X86-64\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545f0fde-be37-4001-8dd8-faf87ac19724)\r\n(Electron override message appears only on NixOS where it is required)\r\n\r\n## Setting Up Devbox + DirEnv (this a one-time setup for all projects using devbox configurations)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to setup devbox+direnv, the general requirements are:\r\n1. Install [DirEnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) + [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/) + [Nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer?tab=readme-ov-file#determinate-nix-installer) (devbox will install nix, if not present)\r\n   - These can be installed via package manager or direct download or after installing nix via `nix profile install nixpkgs#{direnv,devbox}`\r\n2. Add direnv hooks to your shell `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` (i.e. append `direnv hook bash` or `direnv hook zsh`) and source or restart your shell. \r\n",

To avoid the duplicated info I'd suggest adding something like \"The required dependencies are listed in (path/to/devbox.json), or you can automatically install them using devbox: (Here you add your instructions)\"\r\n\r\nSure, I'll write something up and add it to BUILD.md and amend the PR\r\n\r\n> Isn't not possible to run the devbox.json script without having to modify direnv?\r\n\r\nThat's a good shout, it's absolutely possible to start a devbox environment up without direnv by entering the directory and typing `devbox shell`.   I'll add that to the notes in BUILD.md",
