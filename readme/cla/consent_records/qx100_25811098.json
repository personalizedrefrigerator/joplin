		"body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have now updated the translation of Simplified Chinese, and the completion rate has reached 100%. \r\nJoplin has been very helpful to my learning and work, and I am grateful to every contributor. Therefore, I also want to do something about it.\r\n\r\nThank you again.Have a nice day!\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease prefix the title with the platform you are targetting:\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of good titles:\r\n\r\n- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font\r\n- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error\r\n- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster\r\n\r\nAnd here's an explanation of the title format:\r\n\r\n- \"Desktop\" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)\r\n- \"Mobile\" for the mobile app (or \"Android\" / \"iOS\" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)\r\n- \"CLI\" for the CLI app\r\n\r\nIf it's two platforms, separate them with commas - \"Desktop, Mobile\" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with \"All\".\r\n\r\nIf it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.\r\n\r\nThen please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed. Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",
