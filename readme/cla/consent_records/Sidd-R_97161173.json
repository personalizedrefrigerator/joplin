		"body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nFiltered the array of folders for trash and deleted folders before taking its length. Earlier both were being considered which led to trash and deleted folders to be considered as active notebooks and the ui of an active notebook was being displayed. When there was an attempt to create a new note/todo list, the Folder.defaultFolder() returned null in screens/Notes.tsx and when its id was accessed, it gave cannot read property error.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Fixes #10065\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nFiltered the folders using the following logic:\r\n - Used the folder id of trash folder to filter it out.\r\n - Filtered folders whose deleted time was not equal to 0 to remove deleted folders.\r\n\r\nNow when there are no active notebooks, create new notebook option is shown and the floating button for creating new note/todo is hidden.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![before_](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/assets/97161173/c73d295d-81a3-43b7-a129-50d9743f0bfb)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![after_](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/assets/97161173/7a35b567-0650-4d75-bca4-1e77d051b6fe)\r\n\r\n\r\nTested on Android 13\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to my introduction in forum: - [https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/introducing-sidd-r/36498](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/introducing-sidd-r/36498)",
