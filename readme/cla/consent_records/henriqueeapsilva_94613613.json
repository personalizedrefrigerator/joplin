		"body": "This issue implies that during the process of Importing and Exporting, opening and closing the settings screen closes the previous display that appears during those actions. \r\n\r\nThat happens because the importing screen is a Modal, which means it appears over the main screen, making the setting screen go to the main screen when the back button is pressed and not the previously appearing modal. For that, I choose the following solution:\r\n- a close button is added to show that the import and export processes are processes that happen on the back, and the users can continue using the app. This is an expected behavior that is intuitive and saves time for the user, increasing user experience. I fixed this issue by adding a button that goes with the style of the app:\r\n- adding a button with a clicked-based function to close the modal on showModalMessage.tsx;\r\n- styling on main.scss based on the previous implementation.\r\n\r\nThere's a video with the solution working:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/laurent22/joplin/assets/94613613/da929b13-3f51-43c0-9d4c-de2a39ec921c\r\n\r\n",

I'm not convinced that the option referenced there is the best solution to the original issue. (At least to me, it still doesn't seem to be clear from the UI that opening settings didn't cancel the import/export). I've updated the issue accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you for working on this!",
