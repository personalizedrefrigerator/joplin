		"body": "[FHS recommends](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04s09.html) that user binaries be added to a system in `/usr/local/bin`. This is more than just being picky; macOS 14 and beyond actively refuses to allow users to add to `/usr/bin` even with `sudo`. I was just attempting to install the Joplin CLI on my Macbook and add it to a directory in `$PATH` but was blocked from following the documentation. I'm sure many users have already bumped into this and figured it out, but it's probably good to clear it up in the docs.\r\n\r\nLinux systems may be just as hardline about protecting `/usr/bin` depending on distribution and the use of AppArmor or SELinux. Regardless, the old school recommendation to use `/usr/local/bin` is more universally supported.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease prefix the title with the platform you are targetting:\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of good titles:\r\n\r\n- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font\r\n- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error\r\n- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster\r\n\r\nAnd here's an explanation of the title format:\r\n\r\n- \"Desktop\" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)\r\n- \"Mobile\" for the mobile app (or \"Android\" / \"iOS\" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)\r\n- \"CLI\" for the CLI app\r\n\r\nIf it's two platforms, separate them with commas - \"Desktop, Mobile\" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with \"All\".\r\n\r\nIf it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.\r\n\r\nThen please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed. Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/dev/index.md\r\n\r\n-->",
