Use \"Resolves #123\" for new features or improvements and \"Fixes #123\" for bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nAdded functionality to deal with alarms in linux starting with a \"-\" symbol. This partially fixes [#7457 ](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/7457)\r\n\r\nI've added a function to escape the first \"-\" in the body of the alarm if one exists. \r\nFor the title, escaping the character did not seem to work as the \"\\\\\\\\\" was simply appended onto the string. Instead I've simply removed all leading dashes from the title.\r\n## Testing\r\nFor testing, the `displayDefaultNotification` function did not seem to return any values, regardless of whether the notification worked or not and hence I was not able to think of a good way to test it. Instead I've added tests for the above mentioned functions themselves, making sure that the dashes are correctly dealt with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
