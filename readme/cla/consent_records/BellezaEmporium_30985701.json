The assistent is supposed to let the author know that a CLA has to be signed and how.\r\n\r\nP.S.: The same is happening with other PRs. We can't really merge anything until this is fixed, correct?\r\n\r\nP.P.S.: I think I found the issue, but I can't fix it, since there are a few inconsistencies and only you know what's going on:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRun contributor-assistant/github-action@v2.3.2\r\n  with:\r\n    path-to-signatures: readme/cla/signatures.json\r\n    path-to-document: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/cla.md\r\n    branch: cla_signatures\r\n    allowlist: joplinbot,renovate[bot]\r\n    lock-pullrequest-aftermerge: false\r\n    use-dco-flag: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, it seems that the branch `cla_signatures` is used. Is this really the way it should be? Shouldn't the signatures be in the default branch? Either way, the directory structure is different between the `dev` and the `cla_signatures` branch.\r\n\r\n`readme/cla/signatures.json` vs `readme/cla_signatures.json`\r\n",
