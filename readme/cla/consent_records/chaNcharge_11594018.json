After further testing, I concluded that the issue only occurs when a todo or note is set to focus on the body in Settings, and only when it is the first note in an empty notebook. This was caused by the editorRef being undefined due to CodeMirror not being rendered at the time of note creation. However, a comment stated that this also occurs when the new todo or new note button is clicked twice, but I'm unsure if this was intentional or not, so this was not considered in this PR. Apologies if the solution is a little messy, feedback on code quality would be appreciated if it could be improved. ",
