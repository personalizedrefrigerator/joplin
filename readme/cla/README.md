# CLA Consent Records

This folder contains a permanent archive of Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) signatures for the Joplin project.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a contributor who has signed the CLA. The file includes:

- The pull request metadata where the signature was made.
- All comments on the pull request, including the CLA signature comment.

The purpose of this archive is to ensure that CLA signatures are preserved even if the original pull request or comments are deleted from GitHub.

## File Format

Each file is a `.json` file named using the contributor's GitHub username and user ID, for example:

## Tool

The consent record is generated by running `yarn saveClaConsentRecords` from the root of the project.
